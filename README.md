## MASSEY HACKS X PROJECT: PONG 2

Welcome to Pong 2, a game created by Peter, James, and Eric (our first hackathon project)
Along with the emotional support of our good friend Jimmy ❤❤❤
This project has a time limit of 24 hours for Vincent Massey's 10th Hackathon

## GAME VISION:
The game is simple, it's like pong, but it's even better! We take Pong's classic elements like a paddle and a ball, but we also improved it by adding new challenges! 

Challenges:
- powerup ideas
  - freeze opponent (cyan)
  - speed buff (yellow)
  - blind opposing half (pink)
  - score increment (green)
  - more balls (red)
- 6 paddles!!!
- collision

The goal of the game is to have fun 

## CONTROLS
LEFT PADDLES: QA,WS,ED
RIGHT PADDLES: UJ,IK,OL

PAUSE: P || R
UNPAUSE: SPACEBAR

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Code from Other People

App.java and Panel.java both use code provided by Mr. R McKenzie for his ICS4U class.
